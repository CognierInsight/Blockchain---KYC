Hyperledger Composer implementation wtih custom REST server

An example of how you could on about creating a custom REST API server that uses the npm Composer SDK packages to access and maintain your Hyperledger composer network.  



The project is split into 3 folders

- composer business network
- mongo-db
- server

### Prerequisites

**Python**

``` bash
sudo apt-get install python-minimal
```

**make and essentials**
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

The project uses the next version of Hyperledger Composer so make sure the following npm packages are installed.

Essential CLI tools:

``` bash
npm install -g composer-cli@next
```

Useful utility for generating application assets:

``` bash
npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@next
```

Of course a running docker service is required as well.

As Hyperledger Composer is officialy not supported on Windows, this project is also best run on a Mac or Linux environment.

### Composer business network

To keeps things simple this business network only contains a few types.

- Cargo - assset
- Truck - asset
- Driver - participant
- ChangeTruckDriver - transaction
- ChangeNotification - event
- Address - concept
- CargoType: enum

I tried to include as much as available types as possible to cover as much SDK actions as possible.

The idea is simple.   A driver drives a truck and can request to be the driver of it.  Cargo can be of many types and can be registered in the application and assigned to a Truck.

The ChangeTruckDriver transaction is just to change the driver of a truck.

To get the network up and running just run the `initialize.sh` script in the scripts folder.

It will install Hyperledger Fabric and start up the network.

### Mongo db

The server project uses a mongo database so just run the following command to load up your mongo database from the mongodb folder.

`docker-compose up -d`

### Server

The server project is just a normal nodejs REST server written in Typescript using the Hapi npm package.  As a base template I used this excellent starter kit template and modified it to my liking. https://github.com/Talento90/typescript-node


Many people are wondering how you can link a normal email/password login kind of system to the Composer identity(business network card).  Therefore in this application I use normal JWT route authentication.   Users first request a token by providing their passport details which is a combination of email/password as any normal web application would use. Once a valid token is retrieved the user can use this token to authenticate the client for all future requests.  During these requests I then match the owner of the token to a matching Composer identity.


The idea is that whenever a user accesses a route, I create a new businessnetworkConnection.  This connection requires a business network card to work so I first retrieve it from the cardstore, which is a mongodb implementation in this project.
Once created and connected I can use this connection to access the registries and modify data as I like.  Once finished I disconnect the connection.


To start the server first update the packages.

``` bash
npm install
```

Then build and start the project with the following command

``` bash
npm run buildstart
```

The following routes are available:

**passport**

- POST /api/v1/passport/token:  get new token
- POST /api/v1/passport/user:  get user passport

**driver**

- GET /api/v1/drivers:  get all drivers, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- GET /api/v1/drivers/query:  get all drivers but by using a defined query in the composer-business-network project
- GET /api/v1/drivers/${id}:  get a driver by ID, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- POST /api/v1/drivers: create a new driver
- PUT /api/v1/drivers/${id}: update a new driver
- DELETE /api/v1/drivers/${id}: delete a new driver
- GET /api/v1/drivers/${id}/trucks: get all trucks for driver by query

**truck**

- GET /api/v1/trucks:  get all trucks, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- GET /api/v1/trucks/${id}:  get a truck by ID, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- POST /api/v1/trucks: create a new truck
- PUT /api/v1/trucks/${id}: update a new truck
- DELETE /api/v1/trucks/${id}: delete a new truck
- POST /api/v1/trucks/${id}/change-driver: change the driver of the truck by transaction

**cargo**

- GET /api/v1/cargo:  get all cargo, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- GET /api/v1/cargo/${id}:  get a cargo by ID, can be called with query parameter `resolve=true/false`
- POST /api/v1/cargo: create a new cargo
- PUT /api/v1/cargo/${id}: update a new cargo
- DELETE /api/v1/cargo/${id}: delete a new cargo


All routes, except passport/token, require a JWT header `Authorization Bearer <token>`

### Notes

Obviously there is a lot of copy paste code involved in this. However it is very easy to create an abstract controller that has all the shared code and only overwrite the functions in the entity controllers when extra or custom business logic is needed.  For this demo project I decided to do everything verbose though to make it more clear.
